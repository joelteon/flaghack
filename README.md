flaghack
========

A super easy HaxBall flag changer app.

To use:
1. Open Flag Hack and change your flag to whatever you want.
2. Go to haxball.com. If the flag has been changed successfully, congrats on your sexy new flag. You're all done.
3. If the flag hasn't changed, quit your browser and hit the Refresh button. The flag will probably revert to the US flag (or whichever one is your default.)
4. Change it back to what you want.
5. Go to haxball.com.
6. If the flag is still wrong, email me or something.
